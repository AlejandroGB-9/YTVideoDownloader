# YTVideoDownloader
This is a python script that allows to download videos and music from youtube. 
In works with Tkinter as GUI as it is more agile than introducing the URL in the code, as well as the directory to download it.
It uses Tkinter, pytubefix and moviepy.
## Disclaimer
The use of moviepy is to obtain the video with the highest resolution. Pytubefix only gets the video with audio at 360p, but obtaining both video and audio can be later be fixed and blended into one with moviepy.
